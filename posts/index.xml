<h2 id="how-igf2025-was-organized-a-multilayered-event-experience">How IGF 2025 Was Organized: A Multilayered Event Experience</h2>
<p>Attending IGF 2025 in Lillestrøm (June 23–27) felt like being part of a living, breathing ecosystem of internet governance. Event organizers masterfully structured the gathering into complementary formats, ensuring rich learning, networking, and creative breakthroughs. Here’s how the forum came together:</p>
<h3 id="-workshops--open-forums">🧩 Workshops &amp; Open Forums</h3>
<p>These were the heart of the program: 90-minute deep dives where experts, activists, and newcomers discussed everything from data governance principles to digital identities. Open Forums added another layer—90-minute sessions hosted by major organizations like ICANN or UNESCO, inviting debate on current work and Q&amp;A.</p>
<h3 id="-lightning-talks--flash-sessions">⚡ Lightning Talks &amp; Flash Sessions</h3>
<p>Need a quick hit of inspiration? Lightning Talks (10–20 minutes) and Flash Sessions were the high-speed engines of IGF—concentrated bursts where fresh ideas, project updates, or research findings were shared with the audience.</p>
<h3 id="-main--high-level-sessions">🎙️ Main &amp; High-Level Sessions</h3>

<h3 id="-dynamic--best-practice-forums">🤝 Dynamic &amp; Best Practice Forums</h3>
<p>In addition to workshops and main tracks, IGF 2025 featured Dynamic Coalition meetings—stakeholder-driven working groups focused on themes like IoT, child online safety, or gender and internet governance. There were also Best Practice Forums, where attendees shared successful models and real-world examples.</p>
<h3 id="-networking-sessions--igf-village">🌐 Networking Sessions &amp; IGF Village</h3>
<p>Beyond formal sessions, the event was infused with social energy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Networking rooms offered small-group dialogues on topics like resilience or youth inclusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IGF Village featured physical and virtual booths from NGOs, tech projects, companies, and institutions—perfect for demos, informal chats, and spontaneous meetups.</p>

<h3 id="-host-country--community-minded-events">🌍 Host Country &amp; Community-Minded Events</h3>
<p>IGF 2025 emphasized both global reach and local color:</p>
<ul>
<li>Host country open stages showcased Norway-led discussions on policy and digital public infrastructure.</li>
<li>Social events—from opening receptions to a “Walk to the birth of the Internet” in Kjeller—added cultural depth, bonding the community in relaxed settings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-hybrid-format--inclusivity">🧭 Hybrid Format &amp; Inclusivity</h3>
<p>In a nod to global inclusivity, every session integrated virtual participation—speakers and rapporteurs joined remotely, while on-site attendees engaged in real-time. The result: a truly hybrid experience that welcomed voices across time zones</p>

<p>Thanks for a great conference that also was free to enter.</p>
<p>The accessibility and openness of IGF 2025 made it a space where anyone—regardless of background or budget—could take part in shaping the future of the internet. That spirit of inclusion is exactly what digital governance needs right now: more voices, more perspectives, more collaboration.</p>
<p>Until next time—onward toward a more open, equitable internet.</p>

<h2 id="winter-in-the-loop">Winter in the Loop</h2>
<p>What makes this pilot particularly interesting is the setting: Norway, in winter. Snow-covered roads, icy surfaces, freezing rain, low light levels, and unpredictable weather patterns create conditions that challenge even the most experienced human drivers. For autonomous vehicles (AVs), these challenges are multiplied.</p>
<p>Sensors such as lidar, radar, and cameras are sensitive to snow, slush, and fog. Lane markings may be obscured. Pedestrians are often bundled up and hard to detect. And road edges can disappear under several centimeters of white. Yet, this is exactly the kind of real-world testing that’s needed to make AVs viable in countries like Norway.</p>
<h2 id="my-first-car-ride">My First Car Ride</h2>
<p>Using the autonomous vehicle service starts with the app <strong>Selvkjørende</strong>, which was only for beta testing through TestFlight. After downloading and opening the app, you&rsquo;re welcomed by a clean interface that combines traditional public transport options with the new on-demand self-driving service.</p>
<p>On the home screen, you simply enter your destination. The app then checks for nearby available autonomous vehicles and shows you the estimated wait time. In my case, I selected <strong>Stovner Senter</strong> as my pickup location and was matched with a NIO ES8 vehicle. The app estimated a 7-minute wait, which was far from accurate. It was more like 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The map interface is detailed and responsive, allowing you to see your location, the approaching vehicle, and the planned route. I was picked up near <strong>Haugenstua Station</strong>, and the app showed real-time updates on the vehicle&rsquo;s progress toward <strong>Stovnertårnet</strong>. Both pickup and drop-off points were clearly marked on the map, and the app even displayed how long the vehicle would wait at the pickup location.</p>

<p>During the ride, I could follow the car’s movements on the map in real-time. The interface was smooth, with clear communication about estimated arrival times and vehicle ID. The vehicle itself was quiet and comfortable, and a safety operator was present throughout the journey. It felt futuristic, yet surprisingly normal.</p>
<p>This first ride gave me a sense of how intuitive the user experience is. Everything from ordering the ride to completing the trip was designed to be as seamless as using any other ride-hailing app.</p>

<h3 id="the-passenger-experience">The Passenger Experience</h3>
<p>Inside the car, each passenger has a front-facing screen mounted to the seat in front of them. This display shows the vehicle&rsquo;s current location, speed, nearby traffic, and remaining time to drop-off — similar to what you&rsquo;d see in a robotaxi concept. At one point during the ride, the display indicated &ldquo;8 minutes to Stovnertårnet&rdquo;, and I could follow our lane position and surrounding vehicles visually.</p>
<p>Despite the car driving itself, it felt very safe. The safety operator sat in the driver&rsquo;s seat ready to take over if needed, but the vehicle handled everything on its own: navigating traffic, stopping at intersections, and making smooth turns.</p>
<p>A sticker in the car reminded us not to disturb the safety operator — an important detail that subtly reinforces the experimental nature of the ride. Still, from a passenger’s point of view, the entire journey felt well thought-out and user-friendly.</p>

<h2 id="enhanced-tracking-efficacy">Enhanced Tracking Efficacy</h2>
<p>One pivotal aspect to highlight is the heightened efficacy of tracking afforded by self-hosted analytics. With an increasing number of internet users employing ad blockers, approximately <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/804008/ad-blocking-reach-usage-us/">26%</a> of the online populace, the likelihood of obtaining analytics data for individual users is significantly higher with self-hosted solutions. By hosting analytics on dedicated subdomains such as analytics.yourdomain.com, the probability of encountering script blocking is notably diminished.</p>
<h2 id="ideological-integrity-customer-versus-lead">Ideological Integrity: Customer versus Lead</h2>
<p>A profound ideological shift underpins the migration towards self-hosted analytics, epitomizing a transition from being perceived as a lead to asserting one&rsquo;s status as a valued customer. Google Analytics, with an imposing <a href="https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/web-analytics--1">73% market share</a>, commands a substantial presence in the web analytics landscape. However, the symbiotic relationship between Google Analytics and Google&rsquo;s advertising services underscores a fundamental reality: users are not merely customers but potential leads. This paradigm shift not only underscores a commitment to data privacy but also ensures a more equitable transactional relationship, fostering trust and integrity in analytics practices.</p>
<p>Moreover, from a data privacy standpoint, self-hosting offers unparalleled control and ownership over visitor data. Alleviating concerns surrounding the extent of data accessibility by third-party entities, self-hosted analytics empower website owners with the autonomy to safeguard sensitive information, reinforcing compliance with stringent data protection regulations.</p>
<h2 id="embracing-simplicity-and-efficiency">Embracing Simplicity and Efficiency</h2>
<p>Simplicity, often overshadowed by the allure of complexity, emerges as a guiding principle in the selection of analytics solutions. While Google Analytics boasts a plethora of advanced features catering to diverse analytical needs, the inherent complexity may overshadow its utility for many users. Opting for a self-hosted analytics solution transcends the allure of convoluted functionalities, prioritizing a streamlined user experience tailored to address core analytical requirements. A discerning focus on traffic volume, source attribution, and page engagement underscores the pragmatic approach adopted in the deployment of analytics solutions.</p>
<h2 id="unveiling-my-new-analytics-framework">Unveiling My New Analytics Framework</h2>
<p>In embracing the ethos of self-hosted analytics, the adoption of <a href="https://github.com/electerious/Ackee">Ackee</a> emerges as a testament to a professional commitment to privacy, efficiency, and reliability. While the setup process may necessitate a marginally longer time investment relative to conventional alternatives, the dividends reaped in terms of data sovereignty, and analytical fidelity far outweigh the initial setup complexities. Ackee&rsquo;s open-source architecture coupled with its intuitive user interface exemplifies a confluence of technological innovation and user-centric design, culminating in a superlative analytics experience that transcends conventional paradigms.</p>
<p>In essence, the transition to self-hosted analytics epitomizes a professional evolution towards data autonomy, ideological integrity, and operational efficiency, setting a precedent for conscientious analytics practices in the digital era.</p>

<p>The world of competitive chess has witnessed a seismic shift in recent years. The traditional clash between human grandmasters has now been joined by an unexpected contender: artificial intelligence. As machines continue to evolve, the question looms large: Is this the end of an era for human supremacy in chess?</p>
<p>In this article, we delve into the fascinating rivalry between two exceptional players: World Champion <strong>Magnus Carlsen</strong> and rising star <strong>Hans Niemann</strong>. Their encounters on the board have captivated fans, sparked controversies, and raised fundamental questions about the future of the game.</p>

<h1 id="the-rise-of-magnus-carlsen">The Rise of Magnus Carlsen</h1>
<h2 id="the-chess-prodigy">The Chess Prodigy</h2>
<p>Magnus Carlsen burst onto the international chess scene like a comet. His prodigious talent was evident from an early age, and he quickly climbed the ranks. His intuitive understanding of positions, relentless work ethic, and unyielding will to win set him apart. In 2013, he achieved the ultimate pinnacle: becoming the World Chess Champion.</p>
<h2 id="the-reign-of-carlsen">The Reign of Carlsen</h2>
<p>Carlsen’s reign has been marked by a unique blend of creativity, precision, and psychological warfare. His mastery of endgames, ability to grind out wins, and uncanny intuition have left opponents bewildered. His famous “Carlsen grind” is a testament to his tenacity—a slow, methodical squeeze that breaks even the most resilient defenses.</p>
<h2 id="the-machine-challenge">The Machine Challenge</h2>
<p>But then came the machines. Deep Blue, Stockfish, AlphaZero—the silicon adversaries that threatened to dethrone human champions. Carlsen faced these digital opponents head-on, participating in man-versus-machine matches. His resilience was admirable, but the gap between human and machine seemed to narrow inexorably.</p>

    </div>

<h1 id="the-emergence-of-hans-niemann">The Emergence of Hans Niemann</h1>
<h2 id="the-american-prodigy">The American Prodigy</h2>
<p>Enter Hans Niemann, a young American with fire in his eyes and a hunger for victory. Niemann’s rise has been meteoric. His tactical acumen, fearless play, and audacity against established grandmasters have turned heads. And it was during the 2022 Sinquefield Cup that he etched his name into chess history.</p>
<h2 id="the-sinquefield-sensation">The Sinquefield Sensation</h2>
<p>In a matchup against none other than Magnus Carlsen, Niemann caused seismic waves. The world champion, perhaps underestimating his opponent, found himself outplayed. Niemann’s smooth maneuvers and unwavering clock management left Carlsen scrambling. And when the chance arose, Niemann seized it—a victory that reverberated through the chess world.</p>
<h2 id="the-controversy">The Controversy</h2>
<p>Carlsen’s withdrawal from the Sinquefield Cup after losing to Niemann sparked controversy. Was it a tacit accusation of cheating? The chess community debated, but Niemann remained undeterred. His audacious play had disrupted the status quo, and the machine-human balance trembled.</p>
<h1 id="the-endgame">The Endgame</h1>
<h2 id="a-new-paradigm">A New Paradigm</h2>
<p>As we witness the clash of titans—Carlsen’s experience against Niemann’s fearlessness—we realize that chess is evolving. Machines analyze billions of positions per second, but humans bring intuition, creativity, and emotion to the board. Perhaps the future lies in a harmonious blend—a symbiosis where humans guide the machines, and machines elevate human play.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-move">The Final Move</h2>
<p>So, is this truly the end for competitive chess as we know it? Not quite. The battle rages on, and the pieces dance across the 64 squares. Magnus Carlsen and Hans Niemann—their names etched in chess lore—are the vanguards of this new era. As the clock ticks, we await the final move—the one that will define the future of our beloved game.</p>

<h2 id="transform-the-data">Transform the data</h2>
<p>The 3-axis raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ from the accelerometer and gyroscope were used to create this data set. At a constant rate of 50 Hz, the time domain signals (prefix &rsquo;t&rsquo; to signify time) were collected. To reduce noise, they were filtered with a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a 20 Hz corner frequency. Using a low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz, the acceleration signal was split into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ).</p>
<p>The 3-axis signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ depicted in Figure 1 and 2 are the raw data from the accelerometer and gyroscope.</p>

<h2 id="returning-to-kristiania">Returning to Kristiania</h2>
<p>The couple moved back to Kristiania in 1912, he and his wife Nilsen came into close contact with the theater community and the social circle around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulda_Garborg">Hulda</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Garborg">Arne Garborg</a>. The couple founded a dressmaking shop named <a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimen_husflid">Heimen</a> Teiknekontor. It became a permanent sewing room for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Det_Norske_Teatret">the Norwegian Theatre</a>, which was founded in 1913, and Johannessen became a stage worker for the theater. He participated in the infamous theater group after the first performance: &ldquo;Jeppe paa Berget&rdquo; by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludvig_Holberg">Ludvig Holberg</a>. In Heimen&rsquo;s sewing room, the first interest in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunad">Norwegian folk costumes</a> also began to emerge, which led to the reconstruction of the Valdres costume/bunad and the Gudbrandsdal costume/bunad. Johannessen began painting in 1912, although his work as a painter remained for the most part unnoticed by those around him. Throughout his life, Johannessen seemed to distance himself from the rather bourgeois and snobbish artistic community.</p>

<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p>At times had Johannessen alcohol problems, and from 1918 to 1921 was he in a very rough period. An attack of pleuresy in his youth had left him in delicate health. In 1922, was his wife, Nilsen, sick with incurable cancer. In sheer despair was Johannessen unable to control his alcohol consumption. He was found in the gutter of an alley, driven to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_University_Hospital,_Ullev%C3%A5l">Ullevål University Hospital</a>, where the terminally ill Nilsen was sitting next to him when he died of pneumonia at the age of 42 on October 25, 1922.</p>
<p>At the time of Johannessen&rsquo;s death, his wife Nilsen had only four months left to live. During this brief space of time, his wife set about to tidy up both her own life and that of her husband. Assisted by Hulda Garborg, she saw to it that her two daughters were well taken care of, and she sold the company &ldquo;Heimen&rdquo; to <a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondeungdomslaget_i_Oslo">Bondeungdomslaget</a> (the Society of Farm Youth) in 1923 for a purchase sums of about NOK 25,000, which at that time corresponded to 12-13 annual salaries.[<a href="https://www.heimenhusfliden.no/1912-historia-om-heimen-husflid/">2</a>] She also contacted the artist <a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ola_Abrahamsson">Ola Abrahamsson</a>, showing him the ninety works that Aksel Waldemar had painted, without making this known to anyone.</p>
<h2 id="memorial-exhibition">Memorial exhibition</h2>
<p>The painter Ola Abrahamsson made sure that the about 90 leftover canvases of partly large format were shown at a memorial exhibition at <a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blomqvist_Kunsthandel">Blomqvist</a> in January 17, 1923.</p>
<p>The exhibition of these works of art created an overwhelming response with magnificent reviews, although a number of people did not comprehend the direct, realistic messages of his art. Jappe Nilssen, Norway&rsquo;s foremost art critic of the time, the man first to recognize the talent of Edvard Munch and later to become his close friend, wrote what was probably the most positive review of his entire career: &ldquo;&hellip; I can hardly recall having seen anything like this ever before in Nordic art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Munch was also full of enthusiasm: &ldquo;this is something of the most extraordinary that I have ever seen&rdquo;, and &ldquo;finer works are not being painted to-day&rdquo;. The sculptor Gustav Vigeland sent the widow some money. People were astonished to learn that Johannessen only gained prominence after his death. Myths were created about poverty, need, hunger and death in solitude, an echo from the Bohemian period of the 1880s. Johannessen&rsquo;s canvasses were then subsequently packed and stored, and then went into total oblivion.</p>
<p>Thematically, the pictures are very ambitious, and range from the grotesque to the idyllic; from depictions of sexuality, violence, prostitution, alcoholism and war to idyllic and intimate works.</p>

<!--- In his 1992 book, Aksel Waldemar Johannessen, V�r glemte maler (Aksel Waldemar Johannessen, Our Forgotten Painter), Haakon Mehren, by rediscovering this exceptional artist, presents us with a new and revealing trend in Norwegian social criticism represented in art: from Christian Krohg, the naturalist and critic of the bourgeoisie, via the esthete Edvard Munch, to the realist Aksel Waldemar Johannessen, there is a clear trend that leads to the modernist Arne Ekeland. Similarly, Mehren demonstrates the important line in Norwegian-German art from Johan Christian Clausen Dahl and Caspar David Friedrich - via the Norwegian naturalists in Munich and Wilhelm Leibl, leading to Munch, the Berlin session in 1892, and expressionism. German philosophy, Ibsen, Garborg, Hamsun, Bj�rnson and the satirical magazine Simplicissimus all form part of this picture. Mehren shows the pioneering work in the figurative language of Norway�s first proletarian artist, and he shows us how Aksel Waldemar anticipates the German art of "Neue Sachlichkeit" in 1925. (althrough Aksel Waldemar had never ventured out of Norway)
Tor Obrestad, the Norwegian writer and poet, has discovered a great deal of written material on Aksel Waldemar Johannessen in Hulda Garborg�s diaries from 1912 to 1923, and he analyzes the literary climate of that period. He also offers a strong personal declaration of love for the artist.
Prof. Dr. �ivind Storm Bjerke, former head curator at H�vikodden Art Centre (Sonja Henie-Onstad Foundation), now professor at the University of Oslo, analyzes the various pictures and gives a survey of Norwegian art and a critique of artistic activity at the time of Aksel Waldemar Johannessen. He demonstrates that his art forms an autobiographical cycle, a cycle that ends with the paintings Fredl�se (Outlaws) and Korsfestelsen (The Crucifixion).
Prof. Dr. Sybille-Karin Moser at the University of Innsbruck, herself an art historian and painter, who has a close relation to the great art theoretician of our time, Sir Ernst Gombrich, places Aksel Waldemar in an art philosophical context. She refers, among other things, to the 86-year-old Marie Louise von Matosiczky, the last expressionist alive from the same period as Aksel Waldemar, who is represented with two paintings in the Tate Gallery. In a conversation with Dr. Moser, she talks of her paintings from the 1920s, they discuss Aksel Waldemar and contemporary artists with whom she worked, amongst them Max Beckmann.
Prof. Dr. Moser presents the rediscovery of Aksel Waldemar Johannessen�s lifework as a great event in European art history. She is critical of various phenomena in German expressionism and in modern art. She tries to give an answer to the exact "nature"of proper Art, and in doing so, draws on philosophers such as Hans Belting and R. C. Collingwwod.

The exhibition held 1923 in Blomqvist Gallery was reconstructed in the same gallery in 1992 with great success. The following year, 1993, the same exhibition was shown in the art museums of Stavanger, Skien and Bergen. During these exhibitions, several foreign museums and galleries also discovered the artist and paid great interest to him. Under the supervision of the renowned art historian Professor Dr. Erich Steingr�ber, General Director of the Bayerische Staatsgem�ldesammlung in Munich (Pinakothek) and honorable professor at Munich University, new exhibitions were arranged 1994 in Palazzo Te in Mantua and in the Doge Palace in Venice, and later in Castle Maretsch, Bolzano South Tirol. In 1995 exhibitions followed in Castle Lamberg, Steyr (Austria) and then finally in 1996 in Berlin.
Some 100.000 people visited the exhibitions and learned about Aksel Waldemar Johannessen and his work. Hundreds of articles were published in newspapers and magazines around Europe. Since Edvard Munch, no other Norwegian artist had achieved greater success abroad. The catalogue on the artist and the exhibition was published by Electa in Italian, German and English (editor: Prof. Dr. Erich Steingr�ber. Aksel Waldemar Johannessen. Images of a Nordic Drama. Immagini di un dramma nordico. Bilder eines Nordischen Dramas. Electa, Milano 1994. Elemont editori associata).
International museums and institutions have acquired paintings by Aksel Waldemar Johannessen, amongst them the famous collector and museum-founder Prof. Dr. Rudolf Leopold in Vienna. At this moment, discussions are underway to make his work available to the public in a major institution. --->

<p>In 2015, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference">COP21</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris">Paris</a>, 197 parties agreed to establish a legal instrument that would govern climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. This became known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement">Paris Agreement</a>. It includes overarching goals to keep global temperature rise below 2° C, with efforts to limit warming to 1.5 °C, and increase countries’ resilience to climate impacts. It also aims to ensure sufficient financing to achieve these targets. Like with most politic you only need to make an <em>effort</em>. I belive there should have been set a more strict goal.</p>
<p>So, do I agree with everything Thunberg is talking about? No, not everything. But Thunberg has some important points we should not throw under the couch. She is criticising the goals for cutting emissions which cause global warming, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49918719">saying</a>: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t just need goals for just 2030 or 2050. We, above all, need them for 2020 and every following month and year to come&rdquo;. Great! Now what action should be taken? That is a hard question to answer. Even Thunberg has avoided getting into the detail about that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We can no longer let the people in power decide what is politically possible. We can no longer let the people in power decide what hope is. Hope is not passive. Hope is not blah, blah, blah. Hope is telling the truth. Hope is taking action. And hope always comes from the people.” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/28/blah-greta-thunberg-leaders-climate-crisis-co2-emissions">said</a> Greta Thunberg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It remains to be seen how well the aims for COP26 will end up being addressed and if the effects of the conference will be stark enough to convince critics.</p>

<p>Einár&rsquo;s death sent a shock wave in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> and once again has the discussion regarding violence and gang-related activity within the hip hop community emerged. Many of Einár’s songs reference a life of crime, including drugs and weapons. Sweden has seen a rise in organised crime activity in recent years and several shootings have occurred in Stockholm, Göteborg, and Malmö.</p>
<p>Sweden&rsquo;s Minister for Gender Equality and Housing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A4rta_Stenevi">Märta Stenevi</a> twitted that &ldquo;violence must be stopped&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The two new chips look to change that situation, with Apple going all-out for performance, with more CPU cores, more GPU cores, much more silicon investment, and Apple now also increasing their power budget far past anything they’ve ever done in the smartphone or tablet space.</p>
<h3 id="the-m1-pro-the-middle-child">The M1 Pro: The Middle Child</h3>
<p>The first of the two chips which were announced was M1 Pro – laying the ground-work for what Apple calls no-compromise laptop SoCs.</p>
<p>The company divulges that they’ve doubled up on the memory bus for the M1 Pro compared to the M1, moving from a 128-bit LPDDR4X interface to a new much wider and faster 256-bit LPDDR5 interface, promising system bandwidth of up to 200GB/s. That is most likely a rounded number, for an LPDDR5-6400 interface of that width would achieve 204.8GB/s.</p>
<h3 id="the-m1-max-the-big-brother">The M1 Max: The Big Brother</h3>
<p>Alongside the M1 Pro, Apple also announced a bigger brother – the M1 Max. While the M1 Pro catches up and outpaces the laptop competition in terms of performance, the M1 Max is aiming at delivering supercharging the GPU to a total of 32 cores. Essentially it’s no longer an SoC with an integrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">GPU</a>, rather it’s a GPU with an SoC around it.</p>
<p>The packaging for the M1 Max changes slightly in that it’s bigger – the most obvious change is the increase of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory">DRAM</a> chips from 2 to 4, which also corresponds to the increase in memory interface width from 256-bit to 512-bit. Apple is also advertising a massive 400GB/s of bandwidth, which if it’s LPDDR5-6400, would possibly be more exact 409.6GB/s. This kind of bandwidth is unheard of in an SoC, but quite the norm in very high-end GPUs.</p>

using the yearly (average) population stacked by country in a query (linked

unfortunately. I have chosen to filter this query to only include values from
2005 and newer. How you choose to import the query into the script is your

<p>Now that we have cleaned the data and selected the interesting part of the query
(country, year and population). We need to import the data into <code>pandas</code>. We
also need, in this example, to flip the table (switch the place of column and
row).</p>

use population values from 2007-2012 (for the countries that have data for all
the years between), where <code>sklearn</code> will do a prediction for 2013 (we also need
the real value for this year).</p>

However, before we can do that we need to define what attribute we are trying to
predict. This attribute is known as a <strong>label</strong>. The other attributes that will
determine our label are known as <strong>features</strong>. Once we&rsquo;ve done this we will use
<code>numpy</code> to create two arrays. One that contains all of our features and another
one that contains our labels.</p>

that we do not test our model on data that it has already seen.</p>

&lt;p&gt;This is my first time using this platform to write a blog post. I have not
decided on what I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to write about. The platform is still a work in
progress and was created since I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to start a technological blog.
The topics will most likely be relevant to what I&amp;rsquo;m interested in or what I&amp;rsquo;m
working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thank you for taking the time to read this first blog post; hopefully, there
will be more to come in the future. Good-bye!&lt;/p&gt;</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello! Bonjour! Hola! Hei!</p>
