**[Genius.com](https://genius.com/)** (formerly known as Rap Genius) is a site founded in 2009 dedicated to community sourced analyzation of lyrics, documents, and more. The site allows both members of the community and the artists themselves to take a deeper dive into lyrics on a line by line basis and break down details to provide context.

## Misuse of fair use
One of the biggest problems of Genius is the amount of copyright protected content found on their website. In the annotation field for a specific lyric they allow users to add images found on Google. I guess they could say it is within [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), but there are someone that owns that image of a [Mercedes Benz](https://genius.com/17434001). The content is missing identification of the source of the original copyrighted material, supplemented, where possible, with information about the artist, publisher and copyright holder, and year of copyright. I hope that the owners sends 
a DMCA takedown to Genius so, that they have to remove it.

## All your voluntary contribution is owned by MediaLab
When you are contributing towards Genius they give you Genius IQ points. The more IQ you gain the more trust will be given by Genius. They explain it [them self](https://genius.com/8839950) by "IQ is what we call the points you earn by adding knowledge". I like this system of experience gives you higher privliges, unfortnetly not everyone should be given higher privliges based on their contributions. Someone just loves to push their own POV on annontation.

## Plagiarism 
"Plagiarism is the act of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own", like stated on [Genius website](https://genius.com/Nyllock-and-emikael-how-to-avoid-plagiarism-annotated).

## Crowd-sourced
[Should I link to Wikipedia](https://genius.com/12687301)

## Reputation
Spotify had a lyric feature called “Behind the Lyrics” [until](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788998/spotify-lyrics-launches-globally-how-to-access) November 2021, where it got replaced by song lyrics powered by [Musixmatch](https://www.musixmatch.com/).
