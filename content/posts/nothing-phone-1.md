_Please be aware_ that this essay only reflects the author's attitude toward the product(s)! Tested on NothingOS 1.1.3 supplimented by a [Belkin USB-PD GaN Charger 30W](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Charger-Designed-Delivery-WCH001dqWH/dp/B089P38LCY).


Nothing, Nothing, Nothing… We meet again. Last year I purchased the [Nothing ear (1)](https://no.nothing.tech/products/ear-1) wireless earbuds. That has been a decent experience with OK sound quality and a cool transparent design. Sold for a decent price. Okay, enough about the earbuds. Now lets talk about the [Nothing phone (1)](https://no.nothing.tech/pages/phone-1). I ordered the new phone (1) on the release date, July 12, 2022. With the following configuration, 256 GB of storage and 12 GB of RAM in the white color variant. That is the most spec'd out version of the phone, that was delivered on August 18. I knew around mid July that the white 12 GB variant of the phone would be delayed.

Over the 2007-2014 years I have always been super enthusiastic about new smartphones, but it has unfortunately decreased drastically these last years. With phones costing a lot and new features that is not that compelling or not interesting for my usage. My last Android phone was a cracked [Samsung Galaxy S8](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s8-8161.php) that also had a heavly burned-in keyboard layout and notification bar. That was a phone prevoiusly used by my mother, but she was getting a new one. The phone had Android 9 and still kept getting securety updates until I switch to using an [iPhone XS](https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_xs-9318.php) in 2020.

I would like with this essay to give a "costumer like" review of the phone. With less of a spesification/benchmark focus and more of a day-to-day usage point of view.

## Design

The design of the phone is where it really stand out of the crowd. The recycled aluminium sides and flat OLED screen look remarkably similar to an Apple phone. The build quality is very good, and the full HD 6.55in screen is excellent, with a big, bright, crisp and super-smooth, thanks to a 120Hz refresh rate.

## Camera

For the camera I had to compare it to the gcam mod.
