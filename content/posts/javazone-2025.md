JavaZone 2025—Scandinavia’s landmark developer conference—delivered an exciting, two-day immersion into the world of Java held for the first time at Nova Spektrum in Lillestrøm on September 3–4, 2025. 

# A Fresh Venue: Nova Spektrum

With Oslo Spektrum under renovation, JavaZone relocated to Nova Spektrum. Just a short 10-minute train ride from Oslo, the venue offered significantly more space, enhancing the attendee experience with larger, more accessible rooms and an open exhibition hall—a welcome change over previous years.

# More Attendees, More Energy

The move didn’t slow momentum—JavaZone 2025 welcomed approximately 3,800 developers, a few hundred more than the previous year, proving that the excitement for this community-driven event remains strong.

A standout feature was the pre-conference workshop day, followed by two full days of lightning talks—quick, dynamic presentations packed with insights. 

Notable Sessions:
* **“Building Secure AI Agents with Quarkus LangChain4j”** – A hands-on workshop guiding participants through AI agent development and security.
* **“Local Development in the AI Era”** – Explored strategies to run AI models and code assistants entirely on local machines using tools like Ollama and Podman.
* **“Non-deterministic? No problem! You can deal with it!”** – Tackled testing AI’s unpredictable nature using Quarkus, Testcontainers, and more. 
* **“Boost Developer Productivity and Experience: A Deep Dive into Quarkus”** – Demonstrated how Quarkus accelerates development workflows with features like live coding, Testcontainers, native images, and AI integration.

# A Community-First Approach

Organized entirely by volunteers from javaBin, JavaZone remains the biggest community-driven Java conference in Norway, consistently fueled by passion and devotion to the developer community since 2001.

Throughout the conference:
* **Food service** was seamlessly integrated into the exhibition hall, eliminating long lunch queues and allowing attendees to grab bites anytime between sessions.
* **The Roman Empire theme** (honoring the “Romerike” region) added a playful, immersive vibe—booths and food stalls were stylized accordingly, creating a festive atmosphere that tied together culture and tech.
