Nils Erik Einar Grönberg AKA. **Einár** was a Swedish rapper. The 19 year old rap sensation was shot to death late Thursday night October 21, 2021. Einàr was the most played artist on [Spotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify) in Sweden 2019. I discovered his music in the early 2019 with the track ["Katten i trakten"](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katten_i_trakten) on repeat. The track was on his debut album [*Forsta klass*](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%B6rsta_klass_(musikalbum)) that topped the Swedish charts in 2019, without the need of any [(major) record labels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label#Major_labels) help.

> "It is a young life that has been extinguished, and I understand that he has meant a lot to many young people," [said](https://www.tv4.se/klipp/va/13723095/stefan-lofven-om-mordet-pa-einar-tragiskt-att-annu-ett-liv-slackts) Swedish Prime Minister [Stefan Löfven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_L%C3%B6fven).

Einár's death sent a shock wave in [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia) and once again has the discussion regarding violence and gang-related activity within the hip hop community emerged. Many of Einár’s songs reference a life of crime, including drugs and weapons. Sweden has seen a rise in organised crime activity in recent years and several shootings have occurred in Stockholm, Göteborg, and Malmö.

Sweden's Minister for Gender Equality and Housing [Märta Stenevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A4rta_Stenevi) twitted that "violence must be stopped".

The motive of the shooting remains unclear but the [police](https://polisen.se/aktuellt/handelser/2021/oktober/21/21-oktober-2250-morddrap-stockholm/) have not ruled out that the incident could be gang-related.

**RIP Einàr you'll always be remembered for your music and description of the contemporary criminal scene in Stockholm ❤**
