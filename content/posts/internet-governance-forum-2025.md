I just returned from the 20th annual Internet Governance Forum (IGF) 2025, held in Lillestrøm (near Oslo), Norway from 23–27 June under the banner “Building Digital Governance Together”. It was a powerful milestone—not just marking two decades of global multistakeholder dialogue, but also showcasing Norway’s commitment to fostering inclusive, sustainable, and collaborative digital governance.

This year’s gathering drew over 8,000 delegates—government officials, civil society advocates, technical experts, youth leaders, and private-sector stakeholders—who joined forces to address pivotal challenges. From Africa’s urgent connectivity and policy needs to inventive sessions like the “Tower of Babel Chaos,” where participants navigated language barriers, the IGF 2025 brought both critical issues and bold experiments to the fore.

In the posts ahead, I’ll dive into how IGF 2025 was organized.

## How IGF 2025 Was Organized: A Multilayered Event Experience

Attending IGF 2025 in Lillestrøm (June 23–27) felt like being part of a living, breathing ecosystem of internet governance. Event organizers masterfully structured the gathering into complementary formats, ensuring rich learning, networking, and creative breakthroughs. Here’s how the forum came together:

### 🧩 Workshops & Open Forums

These were the heart of the program: 90-minute deep dives where experts, activists, and newcomers discussed everything from data governance principles to digital identities. Open Forums added another layer—90-minute sessions hosted by major organizations like ICANN or UNESCO, inviting debate on current work and Q&A.

### ⚡ Lightning Talks & Flash Sessions

Need a quick hit of inspiration? Lightning Talks (10–20 minutes) and Flash Sessions were the high-speed engines of IGF—concentrated bursts where fresh ideas, project updates, or research findings were shared with the audience.

### 🎙️ Main & High-Level Sessions

The Plenary Hall hosted flagship debates: high-level panels and focus sessions on topics like AI, equity, and the internet’s future. These main sessions framed the broader discourse for the week.

### 🤝 Dynamic & Best Practice Forums

In addition to workshops and main tracks, IGF 2025 featured Dynamic Coalition meetings—stakeholder-driven working groups focused on themes like IoT, child online safety, or gender and internet governance. There were also Best Practice Forums, where attendees shared successful models and real-world examples.

### 🌐 Networking Sessions & IGF Village

Beyond formal sessions, the event was infused with social energy:
- Networking rooms offered small-group dialogues on topics like resilience or youth inclusion.
- IGF Village featured physical and virtual booths from NGOs, tech projects, companies, and institutions—perfect for demos, informal chats, and spontaneous meetups.

### 🌍 Host Country & Community-Minded Events

IGF 2025 emphasized both global reach and local color:

- Host country open stages showcased Norway-led discussions on policy and digital public infrastructure.
- Social events—from opening receptions to a “Walk to the birth of the Internet” in Kjeller—added cultural depth, bonding the community in relaxed settings.


### 🧭 Hybrid Format & Inclusivity

In a nod to global inclusivity, every session integrated virtual participation—speakers and rapporteurs joined remotely, while on-site attendees engaged in real-time. The result: a truly hybrid experience that welcomed voices across time zones

Thanks for a great conference that also was free to enter.

The accessibility and openness of IGF 2025 made it a space where anyone—regardless of background or budget—could take part in shaping the future of the internet. That spirit of inclusion is exactly what digital governance needs right now: more voices, more perspectives, more collaboration.

Until next time—onward toward a more open, equitable internet.
