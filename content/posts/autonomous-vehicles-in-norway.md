Ruter is according to Wikipedia "a public transport authority for Oslo and Akershus counties in Norway".[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ruter&oldid=1253945805)] Ruter suggests that on-demand transportation could be a great alternative to private cars. This autonomous vehicles service would pick you up wherever you are and take you to your destination. By sharing the ride with other passengers, the service could reduce the number of vehicles on the roads in Oslo.[[2](https://ruter.no/selvkjorende)]

To achieve this have Ruter startet a pilot project with self-driving vehicles in [the Grorud Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grorud_Valley), Oslo. The purpose of the pilot project is to establish and test a small-scale self-driving transportation service and gain insights and experience from it.[[2](https://ruter.no/selvkjorende)] This is the pilot project i'm a part of.
