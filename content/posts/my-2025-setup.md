This is my 2025 setup.

# Software & Productivity
* [brew](https://brew.sh/) as package manager
* [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) as language & tools management
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as code editor with Copilot integration
* [Bear](https://bear.app/) as notes keeping
* [Arc](https://arc.net/) as browser
* [Kagi](https://kagi.com/) as search engine
* [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/) as AI assistant
* [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) as API client
* [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) as Docker desktop replacement, plus virtual machines
* [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) as music streaming
* Apple ecosystem for mail, calendar, reminders, messaging, and more.

# Degoogling
As can be seen, I am using Kagi, which delivers excellent results without any garbage or ads, instead of Google. I also use email with my own domain through Apple’s iCloud email system, which allows for custom domains, as well as calendar and other features, all outside Google’s domain. Unfortunately, I have to maintain my Google account to use YouTube and occasionally for sites that do not allow creating accounts with a username and password, but only through Single Sign-On (SSO).
