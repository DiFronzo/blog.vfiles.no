* Apple ecosystem for mail, calendar, reminders, messaging, and more.

# Degoogling
As can be seen, I am using Kagi, which delivers excellent results without any garbage or ads, instead of Google. I also use email with my own domain through Apple’s iCloud email system, which allows for custom domains, as well as calendar and other features, all outside Google’s domain. Unfortunately, I have to maintain my Google account to use YouTube and occasionally for sites that do not allow creating accounts with a username and password, but only through Single Sign-On (SSO).
