Starting Sunday (October 31, 2021), climate negotiators from nearly every country will gather for two weeks in [Glasgow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow), Scotland, United Kingdom to hammer out a new agreement aimed at cutting emissions to a level scientists hope will limit global warming, also known as [COP26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference).

[Queen Elizabeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II) was supposed to open it all, but canceled due to illness. [William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge), [Kate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Duchess_of_Cambridge) and [Charles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales), on the other hand, they arrived. And [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama). As well as the world's richest men, like [Jeff Bezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos) and [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates).

...and [Greta Thunberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg) then. But she is at COP26 to protest.
