We are now about to enter a new year so, why not look back on what has happend in the Wikidata Music "department" this year. In good merkeding fashion lets call it **2021 Wrapped Wikidata Music**. With Spotify Wrapped it is a feature that shows you a slideshow of the songs and artists you've listened to the most over the past year, what new music you've discovered, and an exact count of how many minutes you spent listening to music. Unfortunately this Wrapped won't be that personalized or advance, sorry. But hopefully it will be interesting and fun! If you like it, please share this post to everyone that has an interest of ether Wikidata or/and music in general. *#WIKIDATAWRAPPED*

Then let's not waste anymore time, let get into it!
