Technology has been used by chess cheaters in several ways. The most common way is to use a chess program while playing chess remotely, such as on the Internet or in correspondence chess. With software like [Stockfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish_(chess)) or [AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero) anyone can become the best player in the world. The best chess enegines are often solely trained via self-play, using delta amount of first-generation TPUs to generate the games and beta amount of second-generation TPUs to train the [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network).
