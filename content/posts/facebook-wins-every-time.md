I was reading an article in
[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/philippine-nobel-winner-ressa-calls-facebook-biased-against-facts-2021-10-09/)
about a statement given by the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize winner,
[Maria Ressa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Ressa), saying
[Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook) (FB) fails to protect against
the spread of hate and disinformation and is "biased against facts". Ressa lives
in the Philippine that are (per October 2021) the world’s biggest consumers of
social media, spending an average of 4 hours and 15 minutes per day using social
platforms, according to
[Datareportal](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2021-global-overview-report).
Ressa is a journalist in [Rappler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rappler),
Philippine online news website, that she co-founded and that actually started as
a FB page named
[MovePH](https://www.rappler.com/about/rappler-story-independent-journalism-impact)
in 2011, before later evoled into a standalone website. So, what is wrong with
using Facebook?

Before we can answer that exact question, lets take a close look at where
Facebook get its income from. It can't be from us users because Facebook is "free",
right? Well, it depends on what you are considering as a payment. Because as a
user you don't need to pay any [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money) for
using FB, instead FB collects data about you and selling advertising space as
its primary income.
