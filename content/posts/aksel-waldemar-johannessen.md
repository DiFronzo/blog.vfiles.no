Aksel Waldemar Johannessen (1880-1922) was a Norwegian expressionist, painter, and graphic designer. In Norway he is often referred to as "the forgotten artist" and was only praised by critics after his death. Johannessens art was noticed by [Edvard Munch ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Munch)and two famous art critics at the time, Dagbladet's [Jappe Nilssen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jappe_Nilssen) and the cultural profile [Olav Dalgard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olav_Dalgard).

## Early life and education
Aksel Waldemar Johannessen was born October 26, 1880 in Christiania (today [Oslo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo)), Norway. He grew up at [Kampen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampen,_Norway), where his father, Julius Johannesen, was a shoemaker and auxiliary policeman. He was connected early to the artist community at Hammersborg behind the [Trinity Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Church_(Oslo)). In the period of 1900 and 1907, he become educated as an artist, including seven semesters at the [Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_National_Academy_of_Craft_and_Art_Industry), the last years with [Lars Utne](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Utne) in the sculptor class. He learned the art of woodcarving in the workshop of the internationally famous [Johan Borgersen](https://nkl.snl.no/John_Borgersen).

## Work in Gjøvik
Johannessen married Anna Gjermine Nilsen in 1907, and their relationship resulted in two daughters. They moved to [Gjøvik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gj%C3%B8vik) the same year, where he worked as a cabinetmaker and woodcarver in the company Edvard Sandvold. He lived at Sandvoldgård in Welhavens street. Johannessen did not paint at this time, but he made a number of sculptures. They lived in Gjøvik until 1912.[[1]](https://www.oa.no/kultur/omstridte-kunstverk/s/1-81-3089903)

## Returning to Kristiania
The couple moved back to Kristiania in 1912, he and his wife Nilsen came into close contact with the theater community and the social circle around [Hulda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulda_Garborg) and [Arne Garborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Garborg). The couple founded a dressmaking shop named [Heimen](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimen_husflid) Teiknekontor. It became a permanent sewing room for [the Norwegian Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Det_Norske_Teatret), which was founded in 1913, and Johannessen became a stage worker for the theater. He participated in the infamous theater group after the first performance: "Jeppe paa Berget" by [Ludvig Holberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludvig_Holberg). In Heimen's sewing room, the first interest in the [Norwegian folk costumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunad) also began to emerge, which led to the reconstruction of the Valdres costume/bunad and the Gudbrandsdal costume/bunad. Johannessen began painting in 1912, although his work as a painter remained for the most part unnoticed by those around him. Throughout his life, Johannessen seemed to distance himself from the rather bourgeois and snobbish artistic community.

## Death
At times had Johannessen alcohol problems, and from 1918 to 1921 was he in a very rough period. An attack of pleuresy in his youth had left him in delicate health. In 1922, was his wife, Nilsen, sick with incurable cancer. In sheer despair was Johannessen unable to control his alcohol consumption. He was found in the gutter of an alley, driven to [Ullevål University Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_University_Hospital,_Ullev%C3%A5l), where the terminally ill Nilsen was sitting next to him when he died of pneumonia at the age of 42 on October 25, 1922.

At the time of Johannessen's death, his wife Nilsen had only four months left to live. During this brief space of time, his wife set about to tidy up both her own life and that of her husband. Assisted by Hulda Garborg, she saw to it that her two daughters were well taken care of, and she sold the company "Heimen" to [Bondeungdomslaget](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondeungdomslaget_i_Oslo) (the Society of Farm Youth) in 1923 for a purchase sums of about NOK 25,000, which at that time corresponded to 12-13 annual salaries.[[2](https://www.heimenhusfliden.no/1912-historia-om-heimen-husflid/)] She also contacted the artist [Ola Abrahamsson](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ola_Abrahamsson), showing him the ninety works that Aksel Waldemar had painted, without making this known to anyone. 

## Memorial exhibition
The painter Ola Abrahamsson made sure that the about 90 leftover canvases of partly large format were shown at a memorial exhibition at [Blomqvist](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blomqvist_Kunsthandel) in January 17, 1923. 

The exhibition of these works of art created an overwhelming response with magnificent reviews, although a number of people did not comprehend the direct, realistic messages of his art. Jappe Nilssen, Norway's foremost art critic of the time, the man first to recognize the talent of Edvard Munch and later to become his close friend, wrote what was probably the most positive review of his entire career: "... I can hardly recall having seen anything like this ever before in Nordic art."

Munch was also full of enthusiasm: "this is something of the most extraordinary that I have ever seen", and "finer works are not being painted to-day". The sculptor Gustav Vigeland sent the widow some money. People were astonished to learn that Johannessen only gained prominence after his death. Myths were created about poverty, need, hunger and death in solitude, an echo from the Bohemian period of the 1880s. Johannessen's canvasses were then subsequently packed and stored, and then went into total oblivion.

Thematically, the pictures are very ambitious, and range from the grotesque to the idyllic; from depictions of sexuality, violence, prostitution, alcoholism and war to idyllic and intimate works.

## Legecy
The exhibition held 1923 in Blomqvist Gallery was reconstructed in the same gallery in 1992 with great success. The following year, 1993, the same exhibition was shown in the art museums of [Stavanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavanger), [Skien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skien), and [Bergen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen). During these exhibitions, several foreign museums and galleries also discovered the artist and paid great interest to Johannessen. Under the supervision of the renowned art historian Professor [Dr. Erich Steingräber](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Steingr%C3%A4ber), General Director of the [Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_State_Painting_Collections) in [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich) (Pinakothek) and honorable professor at [Munich University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Maximilian_University_of_Munich), new exhibitions were arranged 1994 in [Palazzo Te in Mantua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_del_Te) and in the Doge Palace in [Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice), and later in [Castle Maretsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maretsch_Castle), Bolzano South Tirol. In 1995 exhibitions followed in [Castle Lamberg](https://www.upperaustria.com/en/oesterreich-poi/detail/400364/lamberg-castle.html), Steyr (Austria) and then finally in 1996 in Berlin.

International museums and institutions have acquired paintings by Johannessen, amongst them the famous collector and museum-founder [Prof. Dr. Rudolf Leopold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Leopold) in Vienna.

<!--- In his 1992 book, Aksel Waldemar Johannessen, V�r glemte maler (Aksel Waldemar Johannessen, Our Forgotten Painter), Haakon Mehren, by rediscovering this exceptional artist, presents us with a new and revealing trend in Norwegian social criticism represented in art: from Christian Krohg, the naturalist and critic of the bourgeoisie, via the esthete Edvard Munch, to the realist Aksel Waldemar Johannessen, there is a clear trend that leads to the modernist Arne Ekeland. Similarly, Mehren demonstrates the important line in Norwegian-German art from Johan Christian Clausen Dahl and Caspar David Friedrich - via the Norwegian naturalists in Munich and Wilhelm Leibl, leading to Munch, the Berlin session in 1892, and expressionism. German philosophy, Ibsen, Garborg, Hamsun, Bj�rnson and the satirical magazine Simplicissimus all form part of this picture. Mehren shows the pioneering work in the figurative language of Norway�s first proletarian artist, and he shows us how Aksel Waldemar anticipates the German art of "Neue Sachlichkeit" in 1925. (althrough Aksel Waldemar had never ventured out of Norway)
Tor Obrestad, the Norwegian writer and poet, has discovered a great deal of written material on Aksel Waldemar Johannessen in Hulda Garborg�s diaries from 1912 to 1923, and he analyzes the literary climate of that period. He also offers a strong personal declaration of love for the artist.
Prof. Dr. �ivind Storm Bjerke, former head curator at H�vikodden Art Centre (Sonja Henie-Onstad Foundation), now professor at the University of Oslo, analyzes the various pictures and gives a survey of Norwegian art and a critique of artistic activity at the time of Aksel Waldemar Johannessen. He demonstrates that his art forms an autobiographical cycle, a cycle that ends with the paintings Fredl�se (Outlaws) and Korsfestelsen (The Crucifixion).
Prof. Dr. Sybille-Karin Moser at the University of Innsbruck, herself an art historian and painter, who has a close relation to the great art theoretician of our time, Sir Ernst Gombrich, places Aksel Waldemar in an art philosophical context. She refers, among other things, to the 86-year-old Marie Louise von Matosiczky, the last expressionist alive from the same period as Aksel Waldemar, who is represented with two paintings in the Tate Gallery. In a conversation with Dr. Moser, she talks of her paintings from the 1920s, they discuss Aksel Waldemar and contemporary artists with whom she worked, amongst them Max Beckmann.
Prof. Dr. Moser presents the rediscovery of Aksel Waldemar Johannessen�s lifework as a great event in European art history. She is critical of various phenomena in German expressionism and in modern art. She tries to give an answer to the exact "nature"of proper Art, and in doing so, draws on philosophers such as Hans Belting and R. C. Collingwwod.

The exhibition held 1923 in Blomqvist Gallery was reconstructed in the same gallery in 1992 with great success. The following year, 1993, the same exhibition was shown in the art museums of Stavanger, Skien and Bergen. During these exhibitions, several foreign museums and galleries also discovered the artist and paid great interest to him. Under the supervision of the renowned art historian Professor Dr. Erich Steingr�ber, General Director of the Bayerische Staatsgem�ldesammlung in Munich (Pinakothek) and honorable professor at Munich University, new exhibitions were arranged 1994 in Palazzo Te in Mantua and in the Doge Palace in Venice, and later in Castle Maretsch, Bolzano South Tirol. In 1995 exhibitions followed in Castle Lamberg, Steyr (Austria) and then finally in 1996 in Berlin.
Some 100.000 people visited the exhibitions and learned about Aksel Waldemar Johannessen and his work. Hundreds of articles were published in newspapers and magazines around Europe. Since Edvard Munch, no other Norwegian artist had achieved greater success abroad. The catalogue on the artist and the exhibition was published by Electa in Italian, German and English (editor: Prof. Dr. Erich Steingr�ber. Aksel Waldemar Johannessen. Images of a Nordic Drama. Immagini di un dramma nordico. Bilder eines Nordischen Dramas. Electa, Milano 1994. Elemont editori associata).
International museums and institutions have acquired paintings by Aksel Waldemar Johannessen, amongst them the famous collector and museum-founder Prof. Dr. Rudolf Leopold in Vienna. At this moment, discussions are underway to make his work available to the public in a major institution. --->
