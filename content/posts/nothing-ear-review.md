Nothing, Nothing, Nothing... What is Nothing? Well to quote their own [webpage](https://no.nothing.tech/pages/about) it is "a London-based tech company on a mission to remove barriers between people and technology." The company has the ex-OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei in the CEO chair. So, for those of you who havent heard about the company, Nothing introduced its ear (1) TWS earphones in July this year. The earphones boast stunning design, premium user experience, and much more without costing a lot. Nothing ear (1) features 34 hours of playtime with its carrying case, Active Noise Cancellation support, powerful 11.6mm audio drivers, and costs around $99. They are available in two colorways, black and white.

On the [about page](https://no.nothing.tech/pages/about) for the company they writes "because beautiful tech shouldn’t be complicated." I will most defiantly come back to this statement later in the review.

## Design
Like the Apple AirPods Pro, the earbuds feature silicone tips that give the users advanced comfort. The ear tips come in three different sizes: small, medium, and large. With the medium size pre-installed. I tried to switch from using medium to small. That was more comfortable, but the ear pods kept falling out. So, I returned to using the medium size. I am not a big ear pods user therefore it took some time before the ear got confutable with the size. 

The wireless charging case has a transparent design in plastic. With the bump in the case, it is easy to find the correct place for opening the case. Within the case there is an indicator light that shows status for pairing and battery. The battery level is indicated with either a green or orange/red color. The outside of the case has a USB-C charging port and a button. It’s a wireless charging case that supports QI charging that very helpful in this world of different charging ports. My only complaint with the design is that the transparent case is too prone to scratches.

## Sound quality and functions
In addition, the Nothing ear(1) boasts Clear Voice Technology that results in loud and clear calls.

## My Use-Case
I purchased the earpods to have some music while I work-out, mainly run. It was therefore important with someone light and that had a good fit.
